<p>2025 is there and I have to acknowledge that this blog has been a bit abandoned lately. So now is a good time to bring some life back here and also a good time to reflect on 2024 and what&rsquo;s next.</p>
<h2 id="reflecting-on-2024">Reflecting on 2024<a class="anchor" href="#reflecting-on-2024">#</a></h2>
<p>In many aspects, 2024 has been a rough year with so many crisis in the world. Like many people, I have looked with horrors the genocide in Gaza and felt powerless to participate in anything that could prevent it. I have seen so many people affected by the horrible attacks in Palestine and Lebanon. After many years working in Human Rights, it has been hard to look <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/israel/gaza-and-end-rules-based-order">how inefficient Human Rights and International Law</a> has been to prevent these massacres. The war in Ukraine is continuing and is not showing any sign of positive resolution. The Trump election in Ukraine and the growing far-right and neofascist movement in Europe, US and elsewhere is scary. Capitalism is pushing us slowly but surely into fascism, largely helped by far-right billionnaires like Musk, Bolor√© or XXX, and it is hard to see any effeicient strategy to counter it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Crisis in Kenya, Mozambique,</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Looking more and more at the crisis of the world and the</li>
<li>Feeling powerless</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other side, there have been some positive moments personally this year. My work in the infosec team of Human Rights Watch has been going well and is really interesting. It has been incredible to be involved in such an organization in these crisis times. I have also spent time working with a coach to do a career assessment. After 15 years in infosec, and almost 10 in the NGO world, it has been hard to be as excited to fight against digital surveillance. It is hard to see any improvement in that space and I feel I am looping into the same discussions about the same problems, and trying to solve symptoms rather than the solve the core issues that lead to it (whether it is capitalism, patriarchy or colonialism/racism). I have been more and more interested to work on digital investigations on human rights violations like the HRW DIL or Amnesty Citizen Evidence Lab are doing, that require technical skill but to work on human rights violations beyond tech issues.</p>
<p>I have also really enjoyed doing trainings, I taught digital infrastructures in the third session GIJN&rsquo;s Cyber Investigations Training Course (and the <a href="https://gijn.org/stories/digital-threats-fourth-cyber-investigations-training-course/">4th is coming soon</a>) which was a lot of fun. I also had the great opportunity to lead a training on fighting against unlawful digital surveillance to the <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/">American Bar Association</a>. I also had the privilege to attend the <a href="https://wiki.digitalrights.community/index.php?title=Global_Gathering">Global Gathering</a> in Portugal in September and meet and chat with incredible people in the Internet Freedom space. We finally managed to finish and publish <a href="https://censxres.fr/">our analysis of censorship in France</a> with my friend <a href="https://mastodon.tetaneutral.net/@taziden@mstdn.fr">taziden</a>, something I have been wanting to do for years to expand my knowledge of censorship and legal analysis. And finally, I have spend some time updating and improving <a href="https://echap.eu.org/ressources/">Echap digital security guides</a> and led an online discussion on the dangers of geolocation with domestic violence professionals in September.</p>
<p>So it is the end of a very busy year, where I have learned a lot, read a lot and ended up often overwhelmed and exhausted.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-need-for-a-website">On the need for a website<a class="anchor" href="#on-the-need-for-a-website">#</a></h2>
<p>A quick note on why this website exists: as everyone I have noticed that more and more online content is centralised in big online platforms, social networks of course, but also publications platforms like Medium or Substack. But centralisation is not healthy, a lot of these platforms hold way too much power, way too many data on people and are not reliable. We have seen the quick destructions of Twitter by an egoistic billionnaire, but we also see everyday the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshitification</a> of many services, just because the need for investors is not the one of the users. And now we also have to avoid <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/reddit-ai-content-licensing-deal-with-google-sources-say-2024-02-22/">our own content to be used</a> to train stupid AI algorithms regardless of any copyright law, or abusing copyleft one (my own <a href="/">robots.txt</a> blocks AI platforms even if they probably don&rsquo;t respect it).</p>
<p>So what we need is decentralized and federated tools. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">fediverse</a> is a fascinating exploration of that, but websites and RSS are also a key need. What we need is small decentralised websites that we can easily explore through the RSS tools, that allows to read what you want to follow, and not be influenced by algorithms we don&rsquo;t control. And so here is my small bit of the internet, powered by <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> to generate static files hosted on a small VPS server. No tracker, no external resources, no analytics. Just plain HTML and CSS, and minimal javascript. It is simple and it works, even if I may consider moving to a more complex system to have a federated website.</p>
<p>On a side note, I have also discovered and installed <a href="https://shaarli.randhome.io/">Shaarli</a>, which is an easy way to keep track of interesting articles I am reading and sharing. Each time I find an interesting article, I add it to Shaarli with tags, and it gets automatically shared on my social networks. You can also follow Shaarli with your favourite RSS reader.</p>

<p>Time for new resolutions,</p>
<ul>
<li>need more spaces for thinking and writing. Book clubs are great, need to reuse knowledge I am getting from different reading</li>
<li>Write more often and more comfortably</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="10-rules-for-blogging">10 rules for blogging<a class="anchor" href="#10-rules-for-blogging">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Make writing a habit</li>
<li>Slowly improve my writing process. Editor? Review? How to publish? How to get feedback?</li>
<li>Perfection is the enemy of good</li>
<li>Write for youself</li>
<li>Write short</li>
<li>Write in English mainly, but also sometimes in French or both languages</li>
<li>Open perspectives: infosec and OSINT as core topics but need to expands to other aspects of life and politics</li>
<li>Ecrire des notes mensuelles</li>
<li>References, quote, thanks and h/t of people inspiring or sharing information</li>
</ul>
<p>Inspired from <a href="https://kiesow.net/my-ten-rules-for-blogging-in-2025/">https://kiesow.net/my-ten-rules-for-blogging-in-2025/</a></p>
<p>And keep sharing good music</p>
