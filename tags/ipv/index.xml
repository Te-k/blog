      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.randhome.io/blog/2017/04/23/lets-talk-about-flexispy/&#34;&gt;Flexispy&lt;/a&gt; after the company got hacked and some data was released. It was the first time I encountered stalkerware in my work. Since then, I have had many discussions about this creepy market and more generally technology used in intimate partner violence (IPV) with researchers and activists. I think it is the right time to reflect on what we know about stalkerware and what needs to be done on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
