      <description>I am not sure what happened this year but it seems that Cobalt Strike is now the most used malware around the world, from APT41 to APT32, even the last SolarWinds supply chain attack involved Cobalt Strike. Without relaunching the heated debate on publishing offensive tools, this blog post intends to summarize what an analyst needs to know about Cobalt Strike to quickly identify and analyze it during incidents.&#xA;Finding Cobalt Strike Servers A few months ago, the Salesforce security team published a new active fingerprint tool called JARM.</description>

      <description>Shellcodes are an interesting piece of software because they have to run with unusual constraints. They are also small enough to be used to learn new tools. I have been wanting to learn to use miasm for a long time (since I saw the first presentation at SSTIC some years ago), I finally used a few nights of confinement to learn that, here is a short summary.&#xA;Linux shellcode Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a Linux shellcode as they are less complex than Windows shellcodes.</description>

      <description>TL;DR New trends in targeted attacks against civil society in 2019 :&#xA;More attacks against smartphones, some attacks are using 0-days and we don&amp;rsquo;t know how to be effectively protected against them, but many attacks are using exploits against fixed bugs in Android Phishing attacks bypassing 2 Factor Authentication solutions other than hardware keys are common now. We have to consider that most attacks will support that in the future, and move to hardware tokens for 2FA OAuth attacks are still there and will likely be there for some time.</description>

      <title>Another PE tool</title>

      <description>Analyzing PE files is a basic task in reverse engineering in order to understand their structure, look for anything interesting before going more in depth into the reverse engineering in itself. There are countless tools to do that, on Windows I use PeStudio, PEView and Resource Hacker. But most of the time I want to have a first view of the file before starting my Virtual Machine, so I was looking for a CLI tool on Linux.</description>

      <description>Plop,&#xA;I have been reading many articles about Machine Learning recently, and it seems to be the new hype technology so I wanted to play a bit with these algorithms to better understand the principles behind it. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know machine learning, you should to read this awesome article or this one. This article was largely inspired by this one which analyze the Titanic data.&#xA;Machine Learning and Classification So the idea of machine learning is to let the algorithm learn by itself the best parameters from data in order to make good predictions.</description>

      <description>Hi there!&#xA;I have recently looked different compromised websites on github, mostly using outdated Wordpress/Joomla/Drupal versions. In these cases, I often have to go through many different files to find the malicious one, whether added on the website or added to legitimate files. Here is a short summary of the different tools to detect them.&#xA;ClamAV ClamAV is an open-source antivirus developed for different platform, but also one of the seldom antivirus used on Linux.</description>
