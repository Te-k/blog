      <description>A few years ago, I wrote about Flexispy after the company got hacked and some data was released. It was the first time I encountered stalkerware in my work. Since then, I have had many discussions about this creepy market and more generally technology used in intimate partner violence (IPV) with researchers and activists. I think it is the right time to reflect on what we know about stalkerware and what needs to be done on this topic.</description>

      <description>Introduction: I started this blog post to explain the context of FlexiSpy leaks and show some information I have found during my analysis. This information is incomplete and there is still plenty analysis of source code or binaries to be done. I have uploaded the source code and binaries on github so that everyone can help with it. I will try to report in this articles the publications I have seen on it, but feel free to ping me on Twitter if you see new information or have any question.</description>
